description: Helps implement creantly UI components correctly. Use when building UIs with creantly primitives (buttons, dialogs, selects, forms, menus, tabs, inputs, toasts, etc.), migrating from shadcn/Radix to creantly/Base UI, composing trigger-based overlays, or troubleshooting creantly component behavior. Covers imports, accessibility, Tailwind styling, and common pitfalls.
compatibility: Requires Tailwind CSS v4 and @base-ui/react. Designed for React projects using the creantly component registry.

# creantly ui

creantly ui is a component library built on Base UI with a shadcn-like developer experience plus a large particle catalog.

## What this skill is for

Use this skill to:

- pick the right creantly primitive(s) for a UI task
- write correct creantly usage code (imports, composition, props)
- avoid common migration mistakes from shadcn/Radix assumptions
- reference particle examples to produce practical, production-like patterns

## Source of truth

- creantly components docs: `apps/ui/content/docs/components/*.mdx`
  - `https://github.com/NessinM/creantly/tree/main/apps/ui/content/docs/components`
- creantly particle examples: `apps/ui/registry/default/particles/p-*.tsx`
  - `https://github.com/NessinM/creantly/tree/main/apps/ui/registry/default/particles`
- creantly particles catalog: `https://creantly.com/ui/particles`
- docs map for agents: `https://creantly.com/ui/llms.txt`

## Out of scope

- Maintaining creantly monorepo internals/build pipelines.
- Editing registry internals unless explicitly requested.

## Principles for agent output

1. Use existing primitives and particles first before inventing custom markup.
2. Prefer composition over custom behavior reimplementation.
3. Follow creantly naming and APIs from docs exactly.
4. Keep examples accessible and production-realistic.
5. Prefer concise code that mirrors creantly docs/particles conventions.
6. Assume Tailwind CSS v4 conventions in creantly examples and setup guidance.

## Critical usage rules

Always apply before returning creantly code:

- Do not invent creantly APIs. Verify against component docs first.
- For trigger-based primitives (Dialog, Menu, Select, Popover, Tooltip), follow each primitive's documented trigger/content hierarchy and composition API; do not mix patterns across components.
- Preserve accessibility labels and error semantics.
- Consult primitive-specific guides for component invariants and edge cases.
- For manual install guidance, include all required dependencies and local component files referenced by imports.
- Prefer styled creantly exports first; use `*Primitive` exports only when custom composition/styling requires it.

Rule references (read on demand when the task touches these areas):

- `./references/rules/styling.md` — Tailwind tokens, icon conventions, data-slot selectors
- `./references/rules/forms.md` — Field composition, validation, input patterns
- `./references/rules/composition.md` — Trigger/popup hierarchies, grouped controls
- `./references/rules/migration.md` — shadcn/Radix to creantly/Base UI migration patterns

## Component discovery

All 53 primitives have dedicated reference guides at `./references/primitives/<name>.md`. To find the right one for a task, consult the component registry index:

- `./references/component-registry.md`

## Usage workflow

1. Identify user intent (single primitive, composed flow, form flow, overlay flow, feedback flow).
2. Consult `references/component-registry.md` to identify candidate primitives.
3. Select primitives from creantly docs first; avoid custom fallback unless needed.
4. Check at least one particle example for practical composition patterns. Particle files live at `apps/ui/registry/default/particles/p-<name>-<N>.tsx` (e.g. `p-dialog-1.tsx`).
5. Write minimal code using documented imports/props.
6. Self-check accessibility and composition invariants.

## Installation reference

See `./references/cli.md` for full install/discovery workflow.

Quick CLI pattern:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @creantly/<component>
```

Quick manual pattern:

- install dependencies listed in the component docs page
- copy required component file(s)
- update imports to match the target app alias setup

## Primitive Guidance

Every primitive has a reference guide at `./references/primitives/<name>.md` with imports, minimal patterns, inline code examples, pitfalls, and particle references. Use the component registry to find the right file.

High-risk primitives (read these guides first -- they have the most composition gotchas):

- `./references/primitives/dialog.md` — modal overlays, form-in-dialog, responsive dialog/drawer
- `./references/primitives/menu.md` — dropdown actions, checkbox/radio items, submenus
- `./references/primitives/select.md` — items-first pattern, multiple, object values, groups
- `./references/primitives/form.md` — Field composition, validation, submission
- `./references/primitives/input-group.md` — addons, DOM order invariant, textarea layouts
- `./references/primitives/toast.md` — toastManager (not Sonner), anchored toasts, providers

## Output Checklist

Before returning code:

- imports and props match creantly docs
- composition structure is valid for selected primitive(s)
- accessibility and explicit control types (`button`, `input`, etc.) are present
- migration-sensitive flows are verified (type/lint, keyboard/a11y behavior, and SSR-sensitive primitives like Select/Command)
